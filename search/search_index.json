This law helps determine planetary motions and has implications for understanding gravitational interactions on both local and cosmic scales. Studying this law allows us to predict planetary movements, satellite orbits, and other celestial dynamics with high accuracy. The following sections provide a detailed exploration of the law, its mathematical derivation, and its computational verification through Python simulations. Kepler's Third Law Kepler's Third Law states: $$ T^2 = \\frac{4 \\pi^2 r^3}{G M} $$ where: - \\(T\\) is the orbital period, - \\(r\\) is the orbital radius, - \\(G\\) is the gravitational constant ( \\(6.67430 \\times 10^{-11}\\) m\u00b3 kg\u207b\u00b9 s\u207b\u00b2), - \\(M\\) is the mass of the central body (e.g., the Sun). Derivation This relationship can be derived from Newton\u2019s law of universal gravitation and circular motion principles. The gravitational force provides the necessary centripetal force to keep an object in orbit: \\[ F = \\frac{G M m}{r^2} = m \\frac{v^2}{r} \\] where \\(m\\) is the mass of the orbiting body, and \\(v\\) is its orbital velocity.
